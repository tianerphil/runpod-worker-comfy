I have customized this worker docker config in these steps:


For local run
clone the repo in vscode
   git clone from https://github.com/blib-la/runpod-worker-comfy.git

create venv using python3.10
    python3.10 -m venv venv
change vscode python interpreter to the venv python interpreter

close and reopen the vscode termial with venv activiated

install the requirements
    pip install -r requirements.txt 


For dockerfile config and start.sh
2. customized the dockerfile and src/start.sh so that it will link to the network volume and run from it, no need to install the comfy and custome nodes anynore
   2.1 in the dockerfile I have disabled all the comfy installation and custom nodes installation
   2.2 in the src/start.sh I have created a symbol link from the defualt docker mount point /runpod-volume to the network volume /workspace
   2.3 in the src/start.sh run the comfy in the venv where all the dependancy are installed, change the log dir to /workspace/ComfyUI/log/comfyui.log
   2.4 deactivate the venv and run the rp_handler.py outside of the venv where the runpod dependancy is installed (did it in the dockerfile)
3. update the runpod serverless tamplate add a env variable, rp_handler.py will read this and put the output into here
    COMFY_OUTPUT_PATH = /workspace/ComfyUI/output


Build docker

   docker build -t liangzhang80/runpod-worker-comfy:dev2 --platform linux/amd64 .
   docker push liangzhang80/runpod-worker-comfy:dev2

Create serverless endpoint
   
   follow the instruction, just remember to add COMFY_OUTPUT_PATH = /workspace/ComfyUI/output in the template

Debug the serverless
   start the serverless endpoint
   local machine make sure venv and vscode python interpreter is correct
   update .env api-key and endpoint ID
   cd assess-test/
   python custom.py
   keep one worker as active logon from web terminal
   tail -f /workspace/ComfyUI/log/comfyui.log
