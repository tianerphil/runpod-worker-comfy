Local Testing
It is useful to test your Serverless Handler code locally before deploying it to RunPod. You can do this by creating a file called test_input.json with a body that looks like this:

{
    "input": {
        "name": "Ashley"
    }
}
You can then create a Python virtual environment and install the runpod module as follows:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install runpod
Once the runpod module is installed, you can test your handler locally as follows:

python3 -u rp_handler.py
This will return an output that looks similar to the following:

WARN   | RUNPOD_WEBHOOK_GET_JOB not set, switching to get_local
INFO   | local_test | Started
WARN   | Local test job results for local_test: {"output": {"greeting": "Hello Ashley"}}
INFO   | local_test | Finished
INFO   | Local testing complete, exiting.
Once you are happy with the results of your local testing, you are ready to deploy your application to RunPod Serverless. This will require you to build a Docker image containing your application code using a Dockerfile.
